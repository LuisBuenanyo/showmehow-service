Sherlock Holmes is a fictional private detective created by British author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.
Known as a "consulting detective" in the stories, Holmes is known for a proficiency with
observation, forensic science, and logical reasoning that borders on the fantastic, which he employs
when investigating cases for a wide variety of clients, including Scotland Yard.

First appearing in print in 1887 (in A Study in Scarlet), the character's popularity became
widespread with the first series of short stories in The Strand Magazine, beginning with
"A Scandal in Bohemia" in 1891; additional tales appeared from then to 1927,
eventually totalling four novels and 56 short stories. All but one are set in the Victorian or
Edwardian periods, taking place between about 1880 to 1914. Most are narrated by the character of
Holmes's friend and biographer Dr. Watson, who usually accompanies Holmes during his
investigations and often shares quarters with him at the address of 221B Baker Street, London,
where many of the stories begin.
